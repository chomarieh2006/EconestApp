Start in navigation. We're going to begin by building up our screens.
 Create space for a home screen.
 then move to homescreen.tsx. We're gonna build this up to have some basic text, and a touchable image that moves us to a screen of our choice using a prop.
 for this example, we'll use kitchen.

Once this is done, make a holder for kitchen screen. add it to stacknavigator. show movement through the different screens.
Next, we're going to build up being able to touch an image in the kitchen screen, have a modal pop up to display and change data, and then
store that information in a db (firebase).


In kitchen, we'll go through react states followed by some brief css tutorials. Once we start to represent the touchable opacity, and can move it around and mess with it, we can build the modal.

for the modal, we'll start by just building it out. show props to define what we always want
this component to be passed when we call it. show some styling stuff that happens when we dont specify.

then, show how if we want soemthing to show in a parent component, we hav eto pass it to the child

do so for th text input. that shouldwrap up the basic tutorial, and give them enough to get started for the front end.

the code chat made has stuff to get a backend going. 

do that next

after backend, i want them to start looking into getting api reccomendations.
